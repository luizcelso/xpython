# XPython

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

XPython is a simple Python CLI script that downloads XVideos videos just by giving a URL or a text file.


### Dependencies

XPython uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) - Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary.
* [Requests] - Requests is the only Non-GMO HTTP library for Python, safe for human consumption.
* [Re] - The third-party regex module, which has an API compatible with the standard library re module.
* [Validator Collection](http://validator-collection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Python library of 60+ commonly-used validator functions.

* [Os.path] - The os.path module is always the path module suitable for the operating system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths. However, you can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a path that is always in one of the different formats.


### Usage


```sh
$ python x.py url https://...
or
$ python x.py file file.txt
```
